### Weather Trends

#### Application to display weather trends of a specific zipcode

### Built on node.js v6.2.0

Must have Node and npm installed. Run `npm install` from terminal.
This will install dependencies and run a `postinstall` script to compile all needed code.

(`postinstall`: `gulp dev` to compile **css** from **scss** and to bundle all **js** files together, as well as moving all **html** and image files to the proper location)

Must export a **Weather Source** api key to environment as `API_KEY` for application to work properly. (The **dotenv** node package will export any such variables included in a file `.env`)

`npm start` will start the server.
